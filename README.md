# Handwritten Digit Recognition in Python

This Python script demonstrates a simple implementation of handwritten digit recognition without relying on any external libraries. The purpose is to showcase a basic understanding of image processing and pattern recognition techniques.

## Prerequisites

To run this script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. No additional libraries are required for this implementation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:


## Description

The script uses a basic approach to recognize handwritten digits. The main steps include:

1. **Image Input:** Accepts a grayscale image of a handwritten digit as input.

2. **Preprocessing:** Applies basic preprocessing techniques such as resizing and normalization to prepare the image for recognition.

3. **Feature Extraction:** Extracts relevant features from the image, such as pixel values.

4. **Pattern Recognition:** Uses a simple pattern recognition algorithm to classify the digit based on the extracted features.

5. **Output:** Displays the recognized digit on the console.

## Limitations

This implementation has several limitations and is meant for educational purposes. It may not be as accurate or efficient as more advanced digit recognition systems that leverage machine learning libraries.

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to the project by opening issues or submitting pull requests. Any improvements or enhancements to the digit recognition algorithm are highly appreciated.
